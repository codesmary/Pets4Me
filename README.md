We’re here to kick ass and make a cool website... and we’re all outta ass.

## Frontend

### First time setup

Make sure you have Node v13.9.0

It is recommended to use *nvm* to install Node:

Now all you need to do to set up the project is run

`npm install --user`

from the `frontend` directory.

### Running

Make sure you are in the `frontend` directory.

To run the development server use `npm run dev`.

To run the production optimized server, first build:

`npm run build`

Then start the server:

`PORT=8080 npm start`
